### Hi there 👋

I'm Amélia (acceptable nicknames: Amy, Lia, Ame; acceptable pronouns:
they/them), a Brazilian mathematician working independently on homotopy
type theory and formalised category theory.

- 🔭 I work on [the 1Lab] ([source](https://github.com/plt-amy/1lab)), a
formalised, cross-linked, explorable reference resource for cubical
methods in homotopy type theory, featuring almost twenty thousand lines
each of prose and of code. In addition to the mathematics, the project
serves as an experiment for bringing Agda publishing on the web to
21st-century standards.

[the 1Lab]: https://1lab.dev

- ⏪ I worked on the type checker for the [Amulet programming language],
where I independently re-implemented many of GHC's trickier type system
features, including (but not limited to) GADTs, type families, type
classes with functional dependencies, and "quick look" impredicative
polymorphism.

- 💬 Ask me about synthetic homotopy theory, category theory, Haskell
programming, implementation of proof assistants, and formalisation
with Agda.

- 📫 How to reach me: by email, at `me [at] amelia.how`.
